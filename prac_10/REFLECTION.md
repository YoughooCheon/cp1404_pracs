# CP1404 Practical Reflection

# Estimates

# How accurate were your estimates generally?  

At the start, my estimates were fairly moderate; I often underestimated the time required for debugging and testing.

# How did your estimate accuracy improve throughout the course?  
As the course progressed, I became better at breaking down tasks and anticipating challenges, which helped me create more realistic estimates.

# What did you learn from making these estimates?
I learned that accurate estimating requires experience and accounting for uncertainties, and that it’s important to build buffer time into plans to meet deadlines.

# Code Reviews

# What did you learn from being reviewed by others?  
I gained an appreciation for constructive feedback that improved my code’s readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.

# What did you learn from reviewing others’ code?  
Reviewing others’ work helped me identify common mistakes and broadened my understanding of different coding styles and problem-solving techniques.

# Good Code Review 1

PR Link: https://github.com/YoughooCheon/cp1404_pracs/tree/master/prac_06

Explanation:  
I offered detailed suggestions on input sanitization and added comments to clarify complex logic,
which enhanced the code’s robustness.

# Good Code Review 2

PR Link: https://github.com/YoughooCheon/cp1404_pracs/tree/master/prac_08

Explanation:  
I identified redundant code and recommended modularizing functions to improve maintainability and testability.

# Practicals

# If you were in charge of the subject, what would you change about the practical tasks?
If I were in charge, I would aim to make the grading system more efficient and fair to reduce student stress.
I would also provide clear and constructive feedback to help students better understand their progress and how to improve.
Rather than assigning too many tasks, I would carefully select a reasonable number of practicals with appropriate difficulty levels, allowing students to manage their time effectively.
This balance would enable students to engage more deeply with the material while maintaining a healthy workload.

# What did you do well in the practicals for this subject? 
I managed my time effectively, thoroughly tested my code, and actively sought feedback to improve my work.
