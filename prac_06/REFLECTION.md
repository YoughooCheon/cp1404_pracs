What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have developed the habit of estimating the time required for each task and tracking the actual time spent.
This has helped me manage my study sessions more efficiently and reduce procrastination.
Additionally, I now consistently write comments and docstrings alongside my code to improve readability and make debugging easier.

What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I find it challenging to consistently stick to my planned schedule when juggling multiple subjects and assignments.
Sometimes, I underestimate the complexity of tasks and donâ€™t allocate enough time to complete them thoroughly.
Moving forward, I plan to be more careful with time management to ensure better quality in my work.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I maintain good coding practices such as modular design, meaningful naming conventions, and writing concise docstrings.
I also regularly test my code with realistic examples before submission, which has been effective.
I will continue to prioritize writing clean, well-documented code.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through the testing and debugging phases toward the end of assignments.
Insufficient testing sometimes leads to avoidable errors in my submissions.
Also, I want to reduce last-minute fixes and adopt a more steady pace throughout the task timeline.

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I suggest including more real-world project scenarios across subjects to better prepare students for practical challenges after graduation.
